244267069959450625,2012-09-08 02:53:02 +0000,Long ADN discussion was long. Back to coding...,
244266837456596992,2012-09-08 02:52:06 +0000,@NateBoat LOL.,
244266783547215872,2012-09-08 02:51:54 +0000,@syropian @nateboat WHO KNOWS. ALL I CARE ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS THAT THERE'S AN IPHONE EVENT NEXT WEEK!!!!,
244266611169701888,2012-09-08 02:51:13 +0000,@syropian @nateboat There is a thing called "change". And once again, it's been 2 months. They may lower the price to $5/year if they wanted,
244266122508124160,2012-09-08 02:49:16 +0000,@NateBoat I listened to it and it was great! I respect your opinion. I also enjoy discussing it with others to see their take.,
244265766059393024,2012-09-08 02:47:51 +0000,@NateBoat @syropian And btw, how did this conversation pivot from the user not getting value out of the service to this LOL,
244265453546004481,2012-09-08 02:46:37 +0000,@NateBoat @syropian No, I definitely understand. App•net is elitist and because of this, they are leaving out "others".,
244264947712929792,2012-09-08 02:44:36 +0000,@NateBoat @syropian For both things, does the customer have the choice to buy it or not buy it?,
244264133850198016,2012-09-08 02:41:22 +0000,@syropian @nateboat Um, how isn't it?,
244263895890538496,2012-09-08 02:40:25 +0000,@NateBoat @syropian That's like saying Apple is elitist because they charge significantly higher prices.,

244262823964856320,2012-09-08 02:36:10 +0000,@NateBoat @syropian What the heck does that have to do with anything lol. They aren't forcing anyone to join.,

244261147497357313,2012-09-08 02:29:30 +0000,@NateBoat @syropian Nate, it doesn't want to hit the critical masses. They've said this a million times.,

244260704658538497,2012-09-08 02:27:44 +0000,@syropian @nateboat I could do this all day. The *platform* is called app•net, their *service* is called Alpha.,
244260359958048768,2012-09-08 02:26:22 +0000,@syropian yeah, you delete that tweet!




lol,
244258409992556544,2012-09-08 02:18:37 +0000,@NateBoat @syropian That was on Twitter, lol.

I said ADN ;),
244252992776306688,2012-09-08 01:57:06 +0000,@NateBoat They are all anxiously waiting for the awesome apps that are being developed for it.,
244252660780376064,2012-09-08 01:55:46 +0000,@NateBoat @syropian All I'm saying is, I haven't seen one person yet on adn complain about it not being worth it or lacking of features.,
244251826168414208,2012-09-08 01:52:27 +0000,@syropian Instead, they are gonna pay the developers to do that.,
244251199346458624,2012-09-08 01:49:58 +0000,@syropian If they gave money back to casual users, what would be the point of paying in the first place.,
244250708449316864,2012-09-08 01:48:01 +0000,@syropian They are working on a 3rd-party dev revshare system. But only people on the service know this.,
244250575015911424,2012-09-08 01:47:29 +0000,@syropian @nateboat They already have their plans on what they're gonna do with the money.,
244249680266031105,2012-09-08 01:43:56 +0000,@syropian @nateboat What they have today wasn't crafted in the first two months.,
244249613354274817,2012-09-08 01:43:40 +0000,@syropian @nateboat You're missing my point. It's totally different today than what it was then.,
244248049688391680,2012-09-08 01:37:27 +0000,@NateBoat I just find it hard to judge something when it's not even 2 months old. Let's not forget what the origins of Twitter were.,
244247517171163136,2012-09-08 01:35:20 +0000,@NateBoat That's the developers job. They are a platform, not a service. The service they offer, Alpha, was to show it actually worked.,
244246656437059584,2012-09-08 01:31:55 +0000,@NateBoat And it's the users decision to connect with IFTTT, app•net has no control of that.,
244246544721776641,2012-09-08 01:31:28 +0000,@NateBoat Even with a million dollars, they aren't magicians.,

243927553742618625,2012-09-07 04:23:55 +0000,@mitchell209 It's obvious they held the event to just get the word out before the new iPhone, since that coverage will take up 2-3 weeks.,
243927024639561728,2012-09-07 04:21:49 +0000,@mitchell209 Nope. They require it to watch the Nokia keynote.,
